## What did I do today?

I got a basic version of the radial menu working. This is used to select power ups and other things. It shows if the user touches the screen anywhere besides the tank. Right now it only has a button for the airstrike powerup, but I will add more soon.

[Check it out](/iron-fury/builds/2024-03-27).

## What did I learn?

- Used my first asset. I got a [radial menu asset](https://github.com/jesuisse/godot-radial-menu-control) from the Godot Asset Library. It was pretty easy to use.

## Demo

Click [here](/iron-fury/builds/2024-03-27) to play.

Draw a path by pressing and dragging on the green tank.
