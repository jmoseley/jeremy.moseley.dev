## WTF am I doing?

So I write code for a living. I build "product" (if you know what I mean). I'm not a game developer. I don't know anything about game development. I hardly even play games. I don't know why I'm doing this. I'm not even sure I want to do this. I'm not even sure I can do this. I'm not even sure I should do this. I'm not even sure I'm going to do this. I'm not even sure I'm going to finish this sentence.

Woah, sorry, copilot got away from me there.

I've always wanted to make a game. I've been writing code since I was a kid, and I love building stuff more than playing it. I've never made a game, so I thought I would document my journey trying to figure all of this out.

There is one small problem though. I don't really know where to start, and I am _terrible_ at art. I also have two small children that take up basically all of my time, so this will probably happen in fits and starts.

## What to do first?

I did a bit of brainstorming about what I would like to build (as opposed to what I _should_ build, which is what I do at work all day long). I've always had this idea of a mostly simple top-down tank game, where you just drive around and blow stuff up basically. I think I can handle that. I'm not sure how to handle the art, but I'll figure that out later I guess.

I wrote some stuff by hand, check it out [at the bottom](#sketches).

## What did I do today?

I found [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). I listened to [a single podcast on the subject](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/02/07/the-godot-game-engine-with-emilio-coppola/), and decided its probably a good place to start and might even hold my hand enough. We shall see.
