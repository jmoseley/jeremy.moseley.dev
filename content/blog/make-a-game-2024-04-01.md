## What did I do today?

Today I took a stab at converting to a space theme. I've been reading [The Art of Game Design](https://schellgames.com/art-of-game-design), and I was thinking about themes. The tank theme risks bringing up undertones of political topics that I don't want to get into. I think a space theme is more neutral and fun. I'm still not totally committed to the idea, but I wanted to play around with it.

[Check it out](/iron-fury/builds/2024-04-01).

No code to share today, most of the changes were in the assets.

## Demo
